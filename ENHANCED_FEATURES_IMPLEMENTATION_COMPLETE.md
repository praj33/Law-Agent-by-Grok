## 🎯 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Usage:
```python
from enhanced_subdomain_bns_agent import create_enhanced_subdomain_bns_agent

# Initialize enhanced agent
agent = create_enhanced_subdomain_bns_agent()

# Process any query - gets subdomain + BNS automatically
response = agent.process_query_with_complete_analysis("My phone was stolen")

# Results include:
# - Domain: criminal_law
# - Subdomain: theft (with confidence)
# - BNS Sections: [Section 303: Theft, Section 304: Punishment for theft, ...]

# Display complete analysis
agent.display_complete_analysis(response)

# Check analysis completeness
completeness = response['analysis_completeness']
# Returns: domain_classified, subdomain_classified, bns_sections_provided, etc.
