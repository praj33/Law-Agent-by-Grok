Article 22 → Protection against arbitrary arrest & detention, right to legal counsel.

Article 14 → Equality before law.

📚 NDPS Act, 1985 (Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act)

Section 8(c) → Prohibition of possession, sale, transport, import/export of narcotics.

Section 21 → Punishment for contravention involving manufactured drugs (imprisonment up to 10–20 years depending on quantity).

Section 22 → Punishment for psychotropic substances.

Section 23 → Punishment for illegal import/export/transshipment of narcotics.

Section 27 → Punishment for consumption (smaller penalties compared to trafficking).

📚 Customs Act, 1962

Section 132 → False declaration, document or statement at customs.

Section 135 → Evasion of duty, misdeclaration, illegal import/export — punishable with imprisonment.

📚 Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023

(Replacing IPC – effective 2024 onward)

Chapter 18 – Economic & Organized Crime

Covers smuggling of banned substances, organized crime, and illegal trade.

Relevant mapping:

IPC 489/Customs violations → Now under BNS smuggling & organized crime provisions.

📚 CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973)

Section 154 → FIR must be registered immediately.

Section 41 → Police power to arrest without warrant.

Section 57 → Person arrested cannot be detained for more than 24 hours without Magistrate approval.

Section 167 → Procedure for remand (extension of custody).

Sections 437 & 439 → Bail provisions (NDPS bail is very strict).

📋 Detailed Legal Process

Immediate Arrest → Airport customs/police can arrest without warrant (CrPC §41, NDPS Act).

Seizure & Documentation → Drugs are seized, panchnama prepared, samples sent for forensic testing.

FIR Registration → Under NDPS Act & Customs Act (CrPC §154).

Custody/Remand → Accused produced before Magistrate within 24 hours (CrPC §57).

Investigation → Statements, forensic lab reports, travel documents verified.

Charge Sheet → Police/customs submit report (CrPC §173).

Trial in Special NDPS Court → Case heard by designated NDPS court.

Judgment → Punishment depends on quantity (small, intermediate, commercial).

Small quantity → Up to 1 year imprisonment or fine.

Intermediate → Up to 10 years.

Commercial quantity → 10–20 years rigorous imprisonment + fine.

⏱️ Timeline & Success Rate

Initial Arrest & FIR: Same day.

Charge Sheet Filing: 60–90 days.

Trial Duration: 1–3 years depending on evidence & backlog.

Conviction Rate under NDPS: ~75% (strict law, very hard to get bail).

💡 Important Notes

NDPS Act is a very strict law → Bail is difficult unless innocence is proven.

Presumption of guilt applies (burden of proof is on accused under Sections 35 & 54 NDPS).

Always seek a specialized criminal lawyer for NDPS cases.

International smuggling cases may involve Interpol, Immigration & Passport Seizure.
