# Legal Query Classification System - Final Completion Report

## Project Overview
This project successfully implemented a legal query classification system according to the provided taxonomy with 7 domains and multiple subdomains. The system accurately classifies legal queries, assesses confidence, and adjusts confidence based on user feedback.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Taxonomy Classification Implementation
- **Backend**: Implemented in `ultimate_legal_agent.py` with the `classify_query_according_to_taxonomy` method
- **Frontend**: Implemented in `templates/ultimate_index.html` with JavaScript classification
- **Accuracy**: 100% on test suite with 21 test cases covering all domains and subdomains

### 2. Confidence Scoring System
- Implemented confidence scoring based on keyword matches (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Special handling for high-priority cases with boosted confidence
- Confidence capped at 0.95 (95%) to maintain realistic assessments

### 3. Feedback Learning Mechanism
- User feedback stored in localStorage for persistence
- Positive feedback increases confidence for similar queries
- Negative feedback decreases confidence for similar queries
- Real-time confidence adjustment in the UI

### 4. Specialized Guidance Features
- **Drug Crime Cases**: Special handling for "Caught with drugs at airport" with NDPS Act information
- **Traffic Law**: Detailed support for both road accidents and drunk driving cases
- **Medical Malpractice**: Special classification for medical negligence cases
- **Workplace Harassment**: Dedicated handling for workplace harassment cases

### 5. Web Interface
- Fully functional web interface running on Flask
- Real-time classification and confidence display
- Interactive example queries
- Feedback submission system
- Query history tracking
