# Constitutional Articles Fixes - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

Based on the user feedback, the following issues have been successfully fixed:

### ❌ **Issues Found (Before)**
1. **Irrelevant Articles**: Agent suggested Article 23 (human trafficking), Article 18 (abolition of titles), Article 102 (MP disqualification) for hacking queries
2. **Low Confidence Noise**: Articles with <50% confidence were cluttering recommendations
3. **Poor Cyber Crime Mapping**: Missing specific mappings for cyber crimes like hacking
4. **Weak Article Relevance**: Articles 19 and 14 were weakly relevant for hacking queries

### ✅ **Fixes Implemented (After)**

#### 1. **Improved Confidence Filtering**
- **Filter threshold**: Only show articles with ≥50% confidence
- **Fallback mechanism**: If no high-confidence articles, show top 3 with ≥30% confidence
- **Quality control**: Eliminates irrelevant low-confidence recommendations

#### 2. **Enhanced Cyber Crime Mappings**
```python
cyber_crime_articles = {
    'hacking': ['21', '19', '300A'],  # Privacy, communication, digital property
    'phone_hacking': ['21', '19', '300A'],
    'data_breach': ['21', '19', '300A'],
    'online_fraud': ['21', '19', '14'],
    'cyberbullying': ['21', '19', '14'],
    'digital_privacy': ['21', '19']
}
```

#### 3. **Better Keyword Filtering**
- **Stop words removal**: Filters out "is", "being", "my", "me", "by", "the", etc.
- **High-relevance keywords**: Prioritizes "hack", "hacking", "privacy", "property", "harassment"
- **Meaningful matching**: Only considers words >2 characters that add semantic value

#### 4. **Improved Relevance Scoring**
- **Cyber-specific bonus**: +5 points for cyber crime article matches
- **Domain matching**: +3 points for cyber domain keywords in cyber queries
- **Semantic relevance**: Higher scores for contextually relevant matches
