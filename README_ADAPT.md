  - Intent analysis (acknowledgment, clarification, dissatisfaction, satisfaction)
  - Learning event detection and recording
  - Automatic conversation termination based on satisfaction or turn limits
  - Context preservation across conversation turns

#### 3. `reward_engine.py` - Multi-Dimensional Feedback Scoring
- **Purpose**: Calculates value of feedback per episode using reinforcement scoring
- **Reward Components** (weighted):
  - **Accuracy (30%)**: Domain classification accuracy, confidence alignment
  - **Helpfulness (25%)**: Route quality, actionable advice, user satisfaction
  - **Clarity (20%)**: Response clarity, structure, explanation quality  
  - **Timeliness (15%)**: Response speed, timeline accuracy
  - **Consistency (10%)**: Domain consistency, confidence stability
- **Learning Rate**: Dynamic adjustment based on performance trends (0.1-0.2 range)

#### 4. `state_memory.py` - SQLite-Based Learning Persistence
- **Purpose**: Tracks agent improvement on queries using persistent storage
- **Database Schema**:
  - `improvement_records`: Individual learning events with confidence changes
  - `query_patterns`: Grouped similar queries with similarity threshold 0.5

  - `confidence_evolution`: Detailed confidence tracking over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Keyword extraction with legal concept mapping

## Adaptive Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Behavioral Adaptation via Reinforcement

The adaptive agent implements reinforcement learning principles through:

```python
# Direct confidence adjustments based on feedback
direct_feedback_adjustment = {
    'positive': +0.25,    # Reinforcement for helpful responses
    'negative': -0.15,    # Penalty for unhelpful responses  
    'clarification': +0.08,  # Engagement reward
    'neutral': 0.0
}
```

**Domain-Specific Learning**: Each legal domain maintains separate confidence adjustments that evolve based on feedback:

```python
# Exponential moving average with high learning rate
alpha = 0.9
domain_confidence[domain] = (1 - alpha) * current + alpha * adjustment
```

### 2. Multi-Stage Dialogue Learning

Conversations progress through structured turns with learning detection:

- **Turn 1**: Initial query processing with base confidence
- **Turns 2-6**: Feedback incorporation, context evolution, strategy adaptation
- **Learning Events**: Detected when confidence changes >0.05 between turns
- **Termination**: Based on satisfaction signals or maximum turn limit

### 3. Feedback Integration System

Comprehensive feedback processing with immediate and long-term effects:

**Immediate Effects**:
- Confidence boost/penalty applied to domain adjustments
- Response strategy modification (assertiveness, detail level)
- Reward calculation for reinforcement learning

**Long-Term Effects**:
- State memory pattern updates for similar queries
- Confidence evolution tracking in database
- Learning statistics accumulation

### 4. Memory and Pattern Awareness

**Query Pattern Recognition**:
```python
# Legal concept mapping for better pattern matching
legal_concepts = {
    'landlord': 'landlord', 'deposit': 'deposit', 
    'employer': 'employer', 'wages': 'wages',
    'cyber': 'cybercrime', 'hack': 'cybercrime'
}
```

**Similarity Threshold**: 0.5 (Jaccard similarity for keyword overlap)
**Pattern Efficiency**: Groups similar queries to reduce pattern proliferation

## Feedback Scoring System

### Multi-Dimensional Reward Calculation

The reward engine calculates scores using weighted components:

1. **Accuracy Component (30%)**:
   - Base reward from feedback type mapping
   - Confidence-performance alignment bonus/penalty
   - Domain consistency evaluation

2. **Helpfulness Component (25%)**:
   - Text analysis for helpfulness indicators
   - Legal route quality assessment (length, specificity)
   - Timeline accuracy evaluation

3. **Clarity Component (20%)**:
   - Response structure analysis (steps, sequence)
   - Appropriate length evaluation (100-500 characters optimal)
   - User clarity feedback processing

4. **Timeliness Component (15%)**:
   - Response speed evaluation (<1s optimal)
   - Timeline accuracy in legal advice
   - Realistic timeline assessment

5. **Consistency Component (10%)**:
   - Domain classification stability
   - Confidence level consistency
   - Route similarity for related queries

### Learning Rate Adaptation

Dynamic learning rate adjustment based on performance trends:
- **Improving Performance** (trend > +0.1): Reduce rate by 5% for stability
- **Declining Performance** (trend < -0.1): Increase rate by 10% for faster adaptation
- **Bounds**: 10%-200% of base learning rate (0.1)

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios

The system is validated against 5 comprehensive test categories:

## Technical Implementation

### Session Management

Each conversation maintains an `AdaptiveContext`:
```python
@dataclass
class AdaptiveContext:
    session_id: str
    conversation_turn: int
    previous_queries: List[str]
    previous_responses: List[LegalAgentResponse]
    feedback_history: List[str]
    confidence_evolution: List[float]
    learning_events: List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

### Integration Points

The adaptive agent integrates with existing system components:
- **Legal Agent**: Base query processing and domain classification
- **Constitutional Integration**: Article-based legal reasoning
- **Data Integration**: Crime statistics and state-specific insights
- **ML Classifier**: TF-IDF + Naive Bayes + Cosine Similarity routing

### Database Storage

SQLite database ensures learning persistence across sessions:
- **Improvement Records**: Individual feedback events with confidence changes
- **Query Patterns**: Grouped similar queries with evolution tracking
- **Confidence Evolution**: Time-series confidence data for analysis
- **Learning Sessions**: Session-level aggregated statistics

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: NLP-based semantic similarity for better grouping
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning integration for strategy optimization  
3. **Multi-Agent Learning**: Cross-session knowledge sharing
4. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Sub-second confidence adjustments
5. **Explainable AI**: Transparent learning decision explanations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Adaptive Query Processing
```python
from adaptive_agent import create_adaptive_agent

# Create adaptive agent with all components
agent = create_adaptive_agent()

# Process query with learning
query = LegalQueryInput(user_input="landlord not returning deposit")
response = agent.process_query_with_learning(query)

# Provide feedback
feedback_query = LegalQueryInput(
    user_input="what legal action can I take", 
    feedback="helpful",
    session_id=response.session_id
)
improved_response = agent.process_query_with_learning(feedback_query)
```

### Multi-Turn Conversation
```python
# Start conversation
session_id, initial_response = agent.start_conversation(
    "someone hacked my bank account"
)

# Continue with feedback
response, should_end = agent.continue_conversation(
    session_id,
    "what evidence do I need",
    feedback_on_previous="very helpful"
)

# End conversation
agent.end_session(session_id)
```

## Conclusion

The Adaptive Agent Core successfully implements Task 2 requirements with comprehensive learning mechanisms, multi-dimensional feedback scoring, and persistent memory awareness. The system demonstrates behavioral adaptation through reinforcement principles while maintaining integration with the existing legal agent infrastructure.
