### Programmatic Usage

You can also use the Legal AI Agent programmatically:

```python
from legal_ai_agent import create_legal_ai_agent

# Create the agent
agent = create_legal_ai_agent()

# Process a query
result = agent.process_query("My child was kidnapped for ransom")

# Format the output
formatted_output = agent.format_output(result)
print(formatted_output)
```

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
python test_legal_ai_agent.py
```

## Architecture

The Legal AI Agent consists of several key components:

1. **ML Domain Classifier**: Uses machine learning to classify legal queries into domains
2. **Subdomain Classifier**: Provides detailed subdomain classification within each domain
3. **Legal Database**: Comprehensive database of all BNS, IPC, and CrPC sections
4. **Constitutional Article Matcher**: Finds relevant constitutional articles for queries
5. **Web Interface**: Flask-based web interface for user interaction
6. **Feedback System**: Collects and processes user feedback to improve accuracy

## Feedback System

The Legal AI Agent includes a feedback system that:
- Collects user ratings (1-5 stars)
- Accepts textual feedback
- Adjusts confidence scores based on feedback
- Stores feedback history for continuous improvement

## Frontend Integration

After every response, the system automatically updates results in the frontend (simple_index.html) so that the web interface always displays the latest analysis, legal provisions, and feedback status.

## Example Queries
