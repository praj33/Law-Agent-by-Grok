Test All ChatGPT Improvements
=============================

This script tests all the improvements suggested by ChatGPT:
1. Fixed domain classification (corporate_law instead of unknown)
2. Relevant constitutional articles (no more irrelevant Article 141, 6)
3. Legal framework integration (Contract Act, IT Act, etc.)
4. Enhanced response structure

Usage: python test_all_improvements.py
