- **Total: 1,014 Legal Sections**

### 4. Improved Domain Classification Accuracy
Enhanced the ML domain classifier with:

- Expanded training data covering all 30+ domains
- Improved keyword matching algorithms
- Better confidence scoring mechanisms
- Enhanced pattern recognition for domain-specific terms

### 5. Web Interface Improvements
Updated the web interface to properly display:

- All 30+ legal domains
- Enhanced example queries for different domain types
- Improved statistics showing actual section counts
- Better domain/subdomain confidence visualization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `ml_domain_classifier.py` - Enhanced training data and confidence thresholds
2. `expanded_legal_domains.py` - Added all 30+ domains with comprehensive keywords
3. `enhanced_subdomain_classifier.py` - Expanded to 155+ subdomains
4. `complete_legal_database.py` - Updated keyword mappings for all domains
5. `templates/ultimate_index.html` - Enhanced UI to display all domains and sections
6. `ultimate_web_interface.py` - Updated stats to show correct counts

### Key Features Added:
- Multi-word keyword detection for better domain matching
- Pattern-based domain recognition for improved accuracy
- Confidence boosting for strong matches
- Comprehensive keyword mappings for all legal domains
- Enhanced feedback system for continuous learning

## Testing Results
The enhanced system successfully classifies queries across all 30+ domains:

- **Criminal Law Query**: "Someone murdered my brother" → Domain: criminal_law, Subdomain: murder
- **Employment Law Query**: "My boss fired me for reporting harassment" → Domain: employment_law, Subdomain: general
- **Financial Crime Query**: "Hackers stole money from my bank account" → Domain: financial_crimes, Subdomain: general
- **Drug Crime Query**: "Caught with drugs at airport" → Domain: drug_crimes, Subdomain: smuggling

## Performance Metrics
- **Domain Coverage**: 30+ major legal areas
- **Subdomain Coverage**: 155+ specific legal subcategories
- **Legal Sections**: 1,014 total sections (358 BNS + 418 IPC + 238 CrPC)
- **Classification Accuracy**: Improved confidence scoring with better threshold management
- **Query Processing**: Real-time analysis with comprehensive legal guidance

## Future Enhancements
1. Continuous learning through user feedback
2. Additional domain-specific legal provisions
3. Enhanced natural language processing for better query understanding
4. Integration with legal databases for real-time updates
5. Multilingual support for broader accessibility

This enhancement significantly improves the Legal Agent's capability to handle ANY type of legal query with comprehensive domain coverage and accurate subdomain classification.
