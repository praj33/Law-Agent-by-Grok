## How to Use

### Option 1: Direct Integration (Recommended)

Replace your current legal agent usage with:

from updated_main_agent import process_legal_query

# Process any legal query
response = process_legal_query("My phone is stolen")
print(response)
```

### Option 2: Class-based Usage

```python
from updated_main_agent import create_updated_legal_agent

# Create agent
agent = create_updated_legal_agent()

# Process queries
response = agent.process_query("My phone is stolen")
print(response)
```

### Option 3: Advanced Usage

```python
from enhanced_legal_agent_with_sections import create_enhanced_legal_agent, LegalQueryInput

# Create enhanced agent
agent = create_enhanced_legal_agent()

# Create query input
query = LegalQueryInput(user_input="My phone is stolen")

# Get structured response
response_dict = agent.process_query_with_sections(query)

# Format response
formatted = agent.format_enhanced_response(response_dict)
print(formatted)
```
