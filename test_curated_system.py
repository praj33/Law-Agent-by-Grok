📋 Domain Identified: Corporate Law / Employment Law

🛑 Issue: Breach of confidentiality and company secrets disclosure, which violates employment contract terms and may constitute criminal breach of trust under Indian Penal Code.

✅ Legal Route (What you should do):

1. Check employee's employment agreement (confidentiality/NDA clause)
   • Review signed confidentiality agreements
   • Identify specific clauses violated
   • Gather evidence of breach

2. File civil suit for breach of contract
   • Under Indian Contract Act, 1872
   • Seek injunction to prevent further disclosure
   • Claim damages for breach

3. Consider criminal complaint if applicable
   • Under IT Act, 2000 (Section 72) if digital data involved
   • Under IPC Section 405 (Criminal breach of trust)

🏛️ RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLES (CURATED):

🟢 Article 19 - 95% Confidence
   📖 Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech etc
   💡 Freedom to practice profession - subject to confidentiality obligations
   ⚖️ Context: Employment and professional obligations

🟢 Article 21 - 90% Confidence
   📖 Protection of life and personal liberty
   💡 Right to life and liberty - includes right to fair legal remedy
   ⚖️ Context: Fair legal remedy and due process

🟢 Article 300A - 83% Confidence
   📖 Right to Property
   💡 Right to property - protects intellectual property and trade secrets
   ⚖️ Context: Intellectual property protection

⚖️ APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK:
   📜 Indian Contract Act, 1872
   📜 Companies Act, 2013
   📜 IT Act, 2000 (Section 72)
   📜 Indian Penal Code (Section 405, 408)

📊 Success Rate: 75% (depends on employment contract terms & evidence of breach)

⏱️ Timeline: Civil suit filing: Immediate. Injunction hearing: 1-2 weeks. Final judgment: 6-18 months."""
